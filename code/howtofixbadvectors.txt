To fix a file produced by the old version of vectorize.py (where comments aren't separated from the end of the line by a space), run the following:

sed 's/\(.*\)#\(.*\)$/\1 #\2/g' vector.svm > newvector.svm 

Where vector.svm is the name of the vector file and newvector.svm is whatever you want the new file to be named. (sed -i makes the changes in place)
